The goal of the organization is to secure homes for as many rescued animals as possible.  In the past 30 years  AWS has found homes for over 20 000 ""unwanted"" felines and canines. These puppies  kittens  dogs and cats are rescued from various pounds throughout Michigan and Ohio  some are strays  and some are owner surrenders. Each accepted animal is given a thorough physical examination  vaccinations and treatment by a participating veterinarian to insure they are healthy and well adjusted. All animals over 4 months of age are spayed or neutered. An incentive sterilization deposit is refunded after the procedure is performed on animals under the age of 4 months.",AWS is an adoption network committed to finding homes for companion animals. We are a no-kill 501(c)(3) non-profit organization  and we place animals of all ages into loving homes. Although we opened our own 5 000 square foot shelter in May  2007  we still rely on a network of volunteer foster homes and owners to hold onto their pets until adopted  as there is simply not enough room in our shelter for all the unwanted animals we wish to save. It is through the generous contributions of caring people that AWS is able to keep our shelter open and save as many animals as we do. AWS offers a Free Pet Food Program to persons needing assistance obtaining food for their dogs and cats.

There is NO time limit on our animals looking for homes  CCHS cares for them for as long as they need us. CCHS cares for about 80 animals each day at our shelter. Education- CCHS provides outreach and education to schools  civic organizations and other interested groups. Speakers discuss various animal-related issues with emphasis on caring for pets. When appropriate  a shelter animal accompanies the speaker  giving audiences a chance to see an example of the animals available for adoption. In addition CCHS uses all forms of media such as TV  radio  newspaper  newsletters and handouts to inform and educate the community about all aspects of animal care. Spay/Neuter Program ??? CCHS is dedicated to controlling the dog and cat population. No animal leaves the shelter without being sterilized (unless advised not to due to health reasons by a veterinarian). In addition  CCHS raises money through volunteer fundraising assist low-income families cover the costs of sterilization procedures. CCHS also provides low cost vaccination clinics to also assist people in keeping their pets healthy and happy. Volunteers ??? Volunteers are the cornerstones of CCHS. The shelter relies on volunteers to assist with all aspects of its daily operations including transporting animals to and from the veterinary clinic  rescuing abandoned and neglected animals  picking up supplies and cleaning kennels.

Our fostering/adoption program has given many homeless animals a second chance at happy  healthy lives by placing them in permanent  loving homes. Through our Spay/Neuter Assistance Program (SNAP)  P.A.W.S. has facilitated  subsidized or fully funded the spaying or neutering of cats and dogs that otherwise would not have been sterilized). ,P.A.W.S. has always been proud of the number of animals we have helped through our fostering and SNAP programs. At the same time  we were haunted and driven by the ones we cannot help. Far too many ??? 3-4 million  according to the Humane Society of the United States ??? are needlessly euthanized across the nation each year because there are not enough homes for all of them. We see these sad statistics reflected in our own local animal shelters  where available documented euthanasia rates are as high as 90 percent. To enable us to save more lives and move closer to ultimately ending animal homelessness  P.A.W.S. of Michigan conceived and launched The PAWS Clinic  a low-cost  high quality  high volume spay/neuter clinic. P.A.W.S. raised the money necessary to open The PAWS clinic through fundraisers  donations  and grants. We were accepted into the National Spay/Neuter Response Team (NSNRT) of Humane Alliance in Asheville  North Carolina  and have been working under their mentorship. Humane Alliance was one of the first high-volume  high-quality  spay/neuter clinics in the country  and has set the standard for success that is being emulated in clinics around the US and Canada. Through their work  Humane Alliance has succeeded in reducing the euthanasia rates in their own local shelter by 79%  proving that their model saves lives. The PAWS Clinic is proud to be the 100th NSNRT clinic in North America  and we???re honored to be a part of this amazing coalition of spay/neuter professionals who are working to end animal overpopulation and homelessness.

Hospitality House works to fulfill this mission by operating a food pantry and providing referral services. In addition  Hospitality House also provides advice and aid to pantries in other cities as they work to fight hunger in the greater southeastern Michigan community.,We provide a variety of interesting service opportunities for groups  individuals  students.

It was during one of our automobile industry downturns and consequently  there were many who found themselves unemployed. Serving from the basement of their church  the East Side Soup Kitchen began in January of 1980 by feeding 15 people for lunch. The critical need they sought to meet is one we still work to address today. We average over 250 lunchtime meals per day in the Kitchen  serving Monday through Friday. We serve people from many walks of life: senior citizens on a fixed income  people with mental and physical disabilities that are unable to work  the working poor and homeless men  women and children. We welcome all guests  from the City of Saginaw and beyond.,THE EAST SIDE SOUP KITCHEN WILL PROVIDE A NUTRITIOUS LUNCHTIME MEAL MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY TO ALL WHO COME TO THE DOOR WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT FOR EACH PERSON.

Our own staff are responsible for planning  ordering and cooking the food. We must always be vigilant about following the Health Department regulations. However  we do rely on volunteers to help with basic preparation such as chopping veggies  opening cans collected from food drives  and serving from the food stations.
