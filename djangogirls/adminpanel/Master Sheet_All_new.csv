Our organization began in 1979 before there was insurance reimbursement for Hospice care and this dedication to our patients remains our culture to this day. Ionia Area Hospice, a Hospice also founded by volunteers, approached Hospice of Lansing with a proposal to join forces and a formal partnership was formed in 1984. Should the time come when it is no longer possible for a patient to remain at home, Hospice of Lansing's Stoneleigh Residence is a unique, comfortable, peaceful, and home-like alternative. Surrounded by gardens, a cascading pond, trees and wildlife, the Residence is designed to take full advantage of the natural beauty of its wooded 22-acre site. This home with eight spacious bedrooms and comfortable gathering areas is a peaceful place for patients, their families and loved ones to spend time together at the end of life. We are a true community-based Hospice, created out of necessity and driven by our mission to serve all by bringing kindness, respect and quality to the end-of-life. Hospice of Lansing, Stoneleigh Residence & Ionia Area Hospice provide pain management and personal care, respite care, emotional and spiritual support for patients, volunteer support and grief support for family members after the loss. ","Our volunteers provide invaluable support to our patients, their families, and to our hospice program. Help is needed working with patients and families as well as non-patient-related activities, such as fundraising/event planning, bereavement support, spiritual care support, community presentations, transportation, office work, or respite care and patient companionship.

","Founded in 1883, YMCAs collectively make up the largest nonprofit community service organization in America. YMCAs are at the heart of community life in neighborhoods and towns across the nation. They work to meet the health and social service needs of 16.9 million men, women and children.Ys help people develop values and behavior that are consistent with Christian principles. Ys are for people of all faiths, races, abilities, ages and incomes. No one is turned away for inability to pay. YMCAs' strength is in the people they bring together.In the average Y, a volunteer board sets policy for its executive, who manages the operation with full-time and part-time staff and volunteer leaders. Ys meet local community needs through organized activities called programs. In its own way, every Y nurtures the healthy development of children and teens; strengthens families; and makes its community a healthier, safer, better place to live.YMCA programs are tools for building the values of caring, honesty, respect and responsibility. Longtime leaders in community-based health and fitness and aquatics, Ys teach kids to swim, offer exercise classes for people with disabilities and lead adult aerobics. They also offer hundreds of other programs in response to community needs, including camping, child care (the Y movement is the nation's largest not-for-profit provider), teen clubs, environmental programs, substance abuse prevention, youth sports, family nights, job training, international exchange and many more.Organization: Each YMCA is a charitable nonprofit, qualifying under Section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Tax Code. Each is independent. YMCAs are required by the national constitution to pay annual dues, to refrain from discrimination and to support the YMCA mission. All other decisions are local choices, including programs offered, staffing and style of operation. The national office, called the YMCA of the USA, is in Chicago, with Field offices in California, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Ohio, Indiana, Minnesota and Texas. It is staffed by 241 employees. Its purpose is to serve member associations.International: YMCAs are at work in more than 120 countries around the world, serving more than 30 million people. Some 230 local US Ys maintain more than 370 relationships with Ys in other countries, operate international programs and contribute to YMCA work worldwide through the YMCA World Service campaign. Like other national YMCA movements, the YMCA of the USA is a member of the World Alliance of YMCAs, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.History: The YMCA was founded in London, England, in 1844 by George Williams and about a dozen friends who lived and worked as clerks in a drapery a forerunner of dry-goods and department stores. Their goal was to help young men like themselves find God. The first members were evangelical Protestants who prayed and studied the Bible as an alternative to vice. The Y movement has always been nonsectarian and today accepts those of all faiths at all levels of the organization, despite its unchanging name, the Young Men's Christian Association.The first U.S. YMCA started in Boston in 1851, the work of Thomas Sullivan, a retired sea captain who was a lay missionary. Ys spread fast and soon were serving boys and older men as well as young men. Although 5,145 women worked in YMCA military canteens in World War I, it wasn't until after World War II that women and girls were admitted to full membership and participation in the US YMCAs. Today half of all YMCA members and program members are female, and half are under age 18.",NA,Photo save,NA,NA,This organization is required to file an IRS Form 990 or 990-EZ.,https://www.facebook.com/cadillacareaymca/,NA,NA,NA,21/2/2018,

The goal of the organization is to secure homes for as many rescued animals as possible.  In the past 30 years, AWS has found homes for over 20,000 ""unwanted"" felines and canines. These puppies, kittens, dogs and cats are rescued from various pounds throughout Michigan and Ohio, some are strays, and some are owner surrenders. Each accepted animal is given a thorough physical examination, vaccinations and treatment by a participating veterinarian to insure they are healthy and well adjusted. All animals over 4 months of age are spayed or neutered. An incentive sterilization deposit is refunded after the procedure is performed on animals under the age of 4 months.","AWS is an adoption network committed to finding homes for companion animals. We are a no-kill 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, and we place animals of all ages into loving homes. Although we opened our own 5,000 square foot shelter in May, 2007, we still rely on a network of volunteer foster homes and owners to hold onto their pets until adopted, as there is simply not enough room in our shelter for all the unwanted animals we wish to save. It is through the generous contributions of caring people that AWS is able to keep our shelter open and save as many animals as we do.

Our fostering/adoption program has given many homeless animals a second chance at happy, healthy lives by placing them in permanent, loving homes. Through our Spay/Neuter Assistance Program (SNAP), P.A.W.S. has facilitated, subsidized or fully funded the spaying or neutering of cats and dogs that otherwise would not have been sterilized). ","P.A.W.S. has always been proud of the number of animals we have helped through our fostering and SNAP programs. At the same time, we were haunted and driven by the ones we cannot help. Far too many ??? 3-4 million, according to the Humane Society of the United States ??? are needlessly euthanized across the nation each year because there are not enough homes for all of them. We see these sad statistics reflected in our own local animal shelters, where available documented euthanasia rates are as high as 90 percent. To enable us to save more lives and move closer to ultimately ending animal homelessness, P.A.W.S. of Michigan conceived and launched The PAWS Clinic, a low-cost, high quality, high volume spay/neuter clinic. P.A.W.S. raised the money necessary to open The PAWS clinic through fundraisers, donations, and grants. We were accepted into the National Spay/Neuter Response Team (NSNRT) of Humane Alliance in Asheville, North Carolina, and have been working under their mentorship. Humane Alliance was one of the first high-volume, high-quality, spay/neuter clinics in the country, and has set the standard for success that is being emulated in clinics around the US and Canada. Through their work, Humane Alliance has succeeded in reducing the euthanasia rates in their own local shelter by 79%, proving that their model saves lives. The PAWS Clinic is proud to be the 100th NSNRT clinic in North America, and we???re honored to be a part of this amazing coalition of spay/neuter professionals who are working to end animal overpopulation and homelessness.
